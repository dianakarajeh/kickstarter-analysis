# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing an in-depth analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover certain trends through Excel
## Project Overview
#### Several thousands of crowdfunding projects and their data were presented within the original kickstarter file under multiple different categories, such as fundraising goal, outcome, deadline, etc.  For this specific challenge, the focus was Louise and her play _Fever_.  _Fever_ was very close to reaching its fundraising goal in the amount of time given, but Louise wanted a deeper look into the other campaigns and how they compared to hers in relation to launch dates and funding goals. A thorough analysis was done to visualize outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals of all the crowdfunding projects given in order to give Louise a thorough analysis of how the other campaigns compared to _Fever_.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis Based on Launch Dates
#### In order to create an analysis based on launch dates, campaigns were filtered by their following outcomes- "successful," "failed," or "canceled".  A column was created in the original kickstarter sheet to retreive the years in which each campaign was launched using the YEAR() function.  To observe the relationship between outcomes and launch date, a pivot table was created by filtering out the parent category (film & video, journalism, music, etc.) and years.  The parent category was filtered to "theater," as all that was going to be analyzed were plays, to Louise's request.  The dates were changed to months in order to create a better visual and grouping of the data.  Columns of canceled, failed, and successful were added to the pivot table in descending order as well as a grand total column.  A visual is placed below:

#### A line chart was created in order to visualize these results above.  Throughout this analysis, I found it challenging figuring out how to filter my categories correctly into the pivot table.  I had to look at the bigger picture and identify which factors I wanted to include and how I was going to filter them in order to get the results I needed.  By remembering that Louise only requested for plays, it was easy to understand that "theater" needed to be filtered in the parent category to get the necessary results.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#### To analzye the campaign results based on goals, The COUNTIFS() function was utilized in order to collect the outcome and goal data for the "plays" subcategory only.  Goal, number (successful, failed, and canceled), total projects, and percentage (successful, failed, and canceled) were created as columns in a new sheet.  Certain dollar-amount ranges were added to the "goal" column in order to group the results.  In order to get the numbers and percentages of successful, failed, and canceled plays; the COUNTIFS() function was used as seen below:
=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D, "<1000", Kickstarter!$F:$F, "Successful", Kickstarter!$R:$R, "plays")
#### This code above specifies the goal being less than $1000, pulling only from the filtered "successful" outcome, and pulling only from the filtered "plays" subcategory.  By referring to the filtered columns from the original kickstarter sheet and using the COUNTIFS() function, it was easy to gather the data that fit the specified range and categories that Louise requested.  The full table of outcomes based on the different ranges of goals is seen below:

#### A line chart of the data above was created to visualize the outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled) based on several different dollar-amount goal ranges.  This will give Louise a better idea of where her campaign falls when compared to the other play campaigns.  Throughout this analysis, I found it challenging using the COUNTIFS() function and making sure I was typing the correct ranges in each code.  I corrected my own error after realizing I had typed "<=999" in the $5000 to $9999 goal range instead of "<=9999," which in return ruined my line chart.
## Results
#### With regards to the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" analyses, out of the 1369 plays; 839 were successful, 493 were failed, and 37 were canceled based on launch dates.  Louise's _Fever_ unfortunately falls under the failed category. The data also shows a gap in the line chart for the month of October.  As seen in the pivot table, there were no canceled theater plays in the month of October which could be seen as pretty impressive.  With regards to the Outcomes Based on Goals data sheet, an interesting discovery was that no number of plays were canceled in any of the goal ranges offered. From <$1000 to >=$50000, none of the projects were canceled.  The most number of successful and failed plays both fell into the $1000 to $4999 goal range, with values of 481 and 222 plays respectively.  Overall, the dataset has shown a thorough analysis of the "successful," "failed," and "canceled" plays with respect to launch date and goals. 
#### Although the dataset was done following Louise's instructions, I believe there could have been some other analyses done to grasp a better understanding of the data at hand. By utilizing more calculations such as the MEAN() function, the average number of plays that fall into the same goal ranges and launch dates as Louise's play could have been calculated and gave her an even smaller and practical dataset to analyze and compare.  As we wanted to show comparable trends of the dataset, utilizing a scatterplot to show where Louise's play falls and comparing that to the others could have also been justifiable.
